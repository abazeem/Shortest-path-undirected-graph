# Shortest-path-undirected-graph
Java Application which determines the shortest path between two selected nodes in an undirected graph


The solution is obtained by modifying the Depth First Traversal in the undirected graph.

I have also attached a small demo video along with the application screenshot in the project.

Java files are placed in the src folder and the JSP, html, css and javascript files can be found in the WebContent folder


Here are the steps to setup code:

1) Download eclipse IDE from the below link : http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/mars1

2) If you dont have an APACHE server installed in your pc, then here is the link which can help you setup APACHE server in eclipse http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/jst/components/ws/1.5/tutorials/InstallTomcat/InstallTomcat.html

3) Download the code from github and import it to your eclipse workspace.

4) Run the index.html page with the above installed server.

PS- if you are getting any errors such as java facet or cross marks on jre libraries then look online for solutions. The fix varies depending on the java versions you have installed in your pc.
